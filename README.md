## Quantum Computing Learning Challenge #1 - Solve Sudoku Instantly

The Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is the problem of minimizing a quadratic polynomial over binary variables. In this challenge, we turn the Sudoku problem into QUBO formulation, and solve it using Fujitsu's Quantum-inspired computer called "Digital Annealer".
